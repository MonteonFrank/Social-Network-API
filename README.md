# Social-Network-API
API creation for a Social Network API

<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>

<p>During these last weeks we learned how to use MongoDB and Mongoose and this application was delevloped using what was seen during the class. This application allows the indivituals to create, update, delete and get users, thoughts and also allows them to add friends to their list. This program is the backend of a social program where the users can add this type of information </p>

<h2><strong>Programming Logic</strong></h2>

<p>I created the models for User and Thoughts and also created dummy information to add. After the model creation, I created a config file to connect MongoDB using Monboose and use it as Object Data Modeling to use Get, Post, Put, Delete in a much simpler way. After the connection was established, I used express to create the routes for Users and Thoughts and created each one of the routes to meet the acceptance criteria.</p>


<h2><strong>What did I learn?</strong></h2>

 <p>During this module, I learned the difference between MySQL and NoSQL as well as the benefits of each one. It also assisted in understanding more about computer science since you need to select what tecnology, method to use based on the project necessities and limitations</p>
